This repo contains one script, run_Analysis.R, which will:
* Read the necessary files (assuming files are located in UCI folder on current directory)
* Appropriately label the columns of data sets
* Add columns for Subject and Activity to both train and test sets
* Combine train and test datasets into one complete data set
* Replace numeric values in Activity column with appropriate descriptive activity names
* Create a second, independent tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* Write the meansTinyData to a space separated text file

Additional information about the variables and procedures found in the run_Analysis.R script can be found in the codeBook.md file.

The run_Analysis.R script also contains informational comments.
